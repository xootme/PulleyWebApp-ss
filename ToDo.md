# ToDo — Timing Pulley Generator

## Backlog

### Packaging
- [ ] PyArmor — machine-specific licence install
- [ ] PyArmor — time-expiring licence install

### Load Testing Dashboard
- [ ] High-load simulation program with real-time dashboard
  - Adjustable number of simulated concurrent users
  - Per-user behaviour controls: download frequency, 2D parameter changes, 3D parameter changes, belt/hub/spoke modifications
  - Real-time display showing each simulated user's current action (e.g. "User 3 — downloading STL with spokes")
  - Summary metrics: requests/sec, error rate, p95 latency, per-endpoint breakdown
  - Designed to surface the same serialisation and OOM issues as the concurrency test harness but under sustained, realistic mixed-workload conditions


### Agent / Headless API Access
Enable programmatic access without a UI so AI agents or scripts can discover and call capabilities.
This same API is shared by CAD plugins (embedded UI, direct download, or agent-mediated) — build once, serve all clients.

**Core API:**
- [ ] `GET /api/capabilities` — machine-readable list of families, pitches, output formats, hub/spoke feature flags
- [ ] `GET /api/describe?family=X&pitch=Y` — parameter constraints (min/max teeth, bore range, enums) and download URL template
- [ ] Consistent JSON error responses (`{"error": "..."}`) on all 400 routes (currently plain text)
- [ ] OpenAPI 3.0 spec at `/api/openapi.json` (hand-written or via flask-smorest) for agent auto-discovery
- [ ] (Optional) MCP server wrapper — exposes each capability as a typed Claude tool with structured geometry responses

**CAD Plugin prerequisites (shared with agent API):**
- [ ] CORS headers on all `/api/` and `/download/` routes — required for browser-context plugins (Onshape, Fusion web panel)
- [ ] `X-Frame-Options: ALLOWALL` (or `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors *`) — required for embedded UI mode (webview/iframe in CAD task pane)
- [ ] API versioning (`/api/v1/`) — plugins ship and rarely update; versioned routes prevent breakage when parameters evolve
- [ ] Freeze public parameter names (`bore`, `teeth`, etc.) — plugin code bakes these in

**CAD platform integration notes:**
- **Fusion 360** — addin already exists (`Fusion Addins/`); add web panel for embedded UI + `adsk.core.WebRequestEvent` for direct download
- **FreeCAD** — Python-based plugin API supports Macros (simple script calls `/download/step` or `/download/dxf` and imports result) and full Workbenches (custom UI panel, toolbar buttons); fits alongside Fusion addin in repo
- **Onshape** — custom tab embeds URL directly; FeatureScript can make HTTP calls for direct-download mode
- **SolidWorks** — task pane hosts a browser control for UI; .NET `HttpClient` for direct calls
- **AutoCAD** — `ShowBrowserWindow` for UI mode; AutoLISP / .NET for direct API calls

**Three plugin integration modes (all share the same server API):**
1. **Embedded UI** — iframe/webview of `cheapcadtools.com/tools/pulleys`; works today with zero server changes once CORS/iframe headers are added
2. **Direct download** — plugin reads CAD context (bore, pitch, etc.), calls `/download/step|dxf|stl`, imports file without user touching a browser
3. **Agent-mediated** — CAD-native AI (Onshape AI, Fusion Copilot, etc.) reads OpenAPI spec, calls endpoints on user's behalf
